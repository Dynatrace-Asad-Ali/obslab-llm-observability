# EasyTravel GPT Travel Advisor

Demo Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM application for giving travel advice.

Uses OpenAI ChatGPT to generate advice for a given destination.

To demonstrate that the RAG is answering from the custom data, the RAG is only trained on two destinations: [Bali](destinations/bali.html) and [Sydney](destinations/sydney.html).

The content is obviously false, again to demonstrate that the data really is pulling from the custom dataset.

- The application will use the contextual (training) information we have provided
- If data is available (ie. you have searched for either Bali or Sydney), data will be returned
- A message of "Sorry, I have no data on <destination>" will be returned for ALL other destinations

## How it works
The user interacts with the demo app (travel advisor) on port `30100`. The app is monitored either via native OpenTelemetry (as per the demo) or (if the user chooses) the OneAgent (eg. the nodeJS version). In both cases, the user enters a destination (eg. Sydney). The application first checks the cache. If a response for Sydney is found, the response is returned from the cache. If a cached response is not available, the application requests advice from the LLM (OpenAI's ChatGPT).

**The call to the LLM is enriched with the custom destination advice ([loaded from the HTML files](destinations)). The LLM is instructed to only provide an answer based on the provided context (ie. the file content)**.

When the response is returned, it is cached so that subsequent calls for the same destination (eg. Sydney) are served from the cache. This saves roundtrips to ChatGPT and thus $.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI Paid Account Required

You need an OpenAI account with credit added to run this demo!

### Create OpenAI API Token

Go to `https://platform.openai.com/api-keys` and create a new API Key.

## Format Dynatrace URL

Make a note of your Dynatrace URL, it should be in the following format:

```
https://ENVIRONMENT-ID.live.dynatrace.com
```

For example:

```
https://abc12345.live.dynatrace.com
```

## Create Dynatrace Tokens

In Dynatrace, press `Ctrl + k` and search for `access tokens`. Choose the first option.

### DT_OPERATOR_TOKEN

Create a new access token with the following permissions:

- Create ActiveGate tokens
- Read entities
- Read Settings
- Write Settings
- Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology
- Read configuration
- Write configuration
- PaaS integration - installer download

### DT_API_TOKEN

Create a second token with these permissions:

- Ingest metrics
- Ingest logs
- Ingest events
- Ingest OpenTelemetry
- Read metrics

### DT_WRITE_SETTINGS_TOKEN

Create a third token with this permission:

- Write settings

## üîÅ Recap

You should now have `5` pieces of information:

- The `DT_URL` (eg. `https://abc12345.live.dynatrace`)
- The `DT_OPERATOR_TOKEN`
- The `DT_API_TOKEN`
- The `DT_WRITE_SETTINGS_TOKEN`
- The `OPEN_AI_TOKEN`

When you have these pieces of information, you can proceed.

## üÜô Time to Fire it up

- On the repo page of Github.com, click the green `Code` button and toggle to `Codespaces`.
- Click the "three dots" and choose "New with Options".
- Enter the values you've from above, in the form fields.
- Create the codespace.

![post creation script](.devcontainer/images/create-codespace.png)

After the codespaces has started (in a new browser tab), the post creation script should begin. This will install everything and will take a few moments.

When the script has completed, a success message will briefly be displayed (it is so quick you'll probably miss it) and an empty terminal window will be shown.

![brief success message](.devcontainer/images/success-message.png)

![blank terminal window](.devcontainer/images/blank-terminal.png)

You may now proceed...

## Accessing and Using Demo

In the codespace, switch to the `Ports` tab. Right click port `30100` and choose `Open in Browser`

![ports open in browser](.devcontainer/images/ports-open-in-browser.png)

A new browser tab will open and you should see the demo.
